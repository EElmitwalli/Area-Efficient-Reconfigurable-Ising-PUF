The MATLAB code here is for generating .CSV files containing the CRPs used in the ECP_TRN ML attack, the generated files should be copied over to python.

CRPGenIsingPUF_SpinChal.m file is for generating CRPs for Ising-PUF considering spin challenges only

CRPGenIsingPUF_SpinConnChal.m file is for generating CRPs for Ising-PUF considering both spin and connection challenges
