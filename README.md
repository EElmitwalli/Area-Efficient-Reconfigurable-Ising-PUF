# Area-Efficient-Reconfigurable-Ising-PUF
Machine Learning Attack Resistant Area-EfficientReconfigurable Ising-PUF

This repository contains MATLAB and Python code used in simulation of the reconfigurable Ising-PUF.

Folders are organized as follows:

MATLAB -> contains the code required for simulating the Ising-PUF and generating CRP files for ECP-TRN ML attack.

TensorBased2021_Ising -> contains the Python code for the ECP-TRN attack, we do not own the copyrights of this code. The code has some changes for Ising-PUF, and is originally from https://github.com/Praneshss/Tensor-Regression-based-Modeling-Attack-on-PUFs
